## svt-av1-psy-quality

This repository provides optimised Windows builds for svt-av1-psyex and svt-av1-psy. Our builds include the newest features, including those are still in the pull request stage and are not yet merged to the testing branch.  

We're also actively looking for ways to improve encoding quality. We include these new features from ourselves into the builds as well. However, we don't intend this repository to be a standalone „fork“. Once we believe a new feature is working, we intend to create pull requests to svt-av1-psyex and get it merged.  

Head to [releases](../../releases) for the builds we're offering, or switch to other branches to view the commit history for these builds.
