## svt-av1-psy-quality

This repository provides optimised Windows builds for all your favourite SVT-AV1 derived encoders, 5fish/SVT-AV1-PSY, SVT-AV1-HDR, SVT-AV1-Essential, and svt-av1-psyex. Our builds include the newest features, including those are still in the pull request stage and are not yet merged to the testing branch.  

Head to [releases](../../releases) for the builds we're offering.  

We're also actively looking for ways to improve encoding quality. We include these new features from ourselves into the builds as well. However, we don't intend this repository to be a standalone „fork“. Once we believe a new feature is working, we intend to create pull requests to upstream forks and get it merged.
